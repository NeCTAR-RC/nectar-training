In the following we will discuss the following tools which support per-file encryption:

* [GnuPG](#GnuPG)

* [AESCrypt](#AESCrypt)

* [Encrypted zip file](#EncryptedZIP)

Other widely known tools which have recently received bad security audits (e.g. *EncFS, OpenSSL, TrueCrypt*) are not discussed in this course.

More detailed instructions are given for *GnuPG*, while the description of the other tools refers to related documentation.



#### <a name="GnuPG"></a> GnuPG

*GnuPG* is an implementation of Pretty Good Privacy (PGP). PGP has excellent security: 

> "To the best of publicly available information, there is no known method which will allow a person or group to break PGP encryption by cryptographic or computational means."     
-- source: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy#Security_quality). 

*GnuPG* is open-source and accessible through a variety of different clients and tools. New versions of PGP are released periodically and vulnerabilities are fixed by developers as they come to light. There is a simple command line interface, but there are also [many graphical interfaces]( https://www.gnupg.org/related_software/frontends.html) available which are more popular. 

The [official releases](https://www.gnupg.org/download/) can encrypt 

* Files 

* Entire volumes

* Disk images

* External drives 

* E-mails

* and more.  

All *GnuPG* tools support multiple encryption types and ciphers.

*GnuPG* works very well on almost all 32 and 64 bit platforms. It has mainly been developed for Unix systems, but binaries available for **Windows, OS X, Debian/Ubuntu, Android and more** provided (with no guarantee that binary versions provided are current). Mac users may be interested in [GPGSuite](https://gpgtools.org/gpgsuite.html). 

*GnuPG* is easy to use and if you keep your private key and the passphrase secret, it is a very secure way to encrypt files. *GnuPG* also has the advantage that no passwords will appear in any script files if you use your private key to encrypt files.

**GnuPG Quick HowTo**

You will have to generate a *key pair* before you can use GnuPG. In the process, you need to specify your E-Mail address (because you can use GnuPG for encrypting E-Mails). Choose the one you usually use, but you can also specify any address and change this later.

* Mac OS X:
    {% img src=images/scrGPGCreateKeyMac.png, w=300, dim=px, alt=image, align=right %} 
    * Download *GnuPG* from the [official website](https://www.gnupg.org/download/index.html). Download the *"binary release" installer* (or get the *"source release"* and follow installation instructions on the website). If you have the choice, select the *GnuPG stable or modern* installer and install the software.
    * Open the *"GPG Keychain"* application (find it with spotlight search). 
    * Click on "New" to generate a new key and specify your name, E-Mail and passphrase.
    * Hit "Generate". Your new key will be listed in *GPG Keychain* after it has been created.
* Windows:
    * Download and install the graphical interface to GnuPG *"GpGForWin"* from [www.gpg4win.org](http://www.gpg4win.org). Make sure *Kleopatra* is checked.
    * Open the *Kleopatra* application which you may find with the app search field or via *Start > Gpg4win > Kleopatra*.
    * Go to *File > New Certificate* and select to create a *personal OpenPGP key pair*. 
* Linux:
    {% img src=images/scrGnuPGKeyLinux.png, w=250, dim=px, alt=image, align=right %} 
    * GnuPG may be available as a package in your distribution. For example in Ubuntu, you may install the *Gnu Privacy Assistant* in the package *gpa*, which includes GnuPG and a graphical interface:    
    ```sudo apt-get install gpa```    
    Or you may install command-line tools only:    
    ```sudo apt-get install gpnupg```    
    If it is not in your package manager, you can download *GnuPG* from the [official website](https://www.gnupg.org/download/index.html). 
    * Start up *gpa*. You may receive an error about not having a key yet. Close this window and confirm to generate your first key now. Enter your details and follow the instructions in the wizard.
    * Alternatively, create a key in the command line.     
    ```gpg --gen-key```    
        * Specify your choices in the command line. Ideally, choose *RSA*, and a *"Real name"* without whitespaces.        
        * **_If_** there is an error about not enough random bytes, you may solve it by starting up an application which takes a lot of cpu time. Or, you can simulate "lots of work" with the *rngd* tool:    
        ```sudo apt-get install rng-tools```    
        ```sudo rngd -f -r /dev/random```    
        In a new terminal:    
        ```gpg --gen-key```    
        When the key generation is finished, cancel the *rngd* application in the other terminal with [Ctr+C].
    * You can find more useful information on the [ubuntu help page](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GnuPrivacyGuardHowto).

Two keys will have been generated: A *public* key which is used for encryption, and a *private* which is used for decryption.

To **encrypt** a file, you must have the *public* key which you want to use for encryption. You have just generated one in the last step.
   
* Mac OS X: 
    {% img src=images/scrGPGEncryptFileMac.png, w=280, dim=px, alt=image, align=right %} 
    * Open the *Finder* and right-click on the file you would like to encrypt.
    * Select *Services > OpenPGP: Encrypt file*.
    * Select your key in the list and click "Ok" (you may also choose several keys).
    * A new file with the same name but ending with *.gpg* will have been created in the same folder.
* Windows: 
    {% img src=images/scrGpgPGWin.png, w=200, dim=px, align=right, alt=image, css=margin-top:20px;%} 
    * Open the *Windows Explorer* and right-click on the file you would like to encrypt.
    * Select *Sign and encrypt*.
    * You may keep the default options in the dialogue, which is set on *Encrypt* by default. Confirm with *Next*. 
    * Select your key in the list and click "Add" to add it to the list (you may also choose several keys).
    * Click "Encrypt" to encrypt the file, and close the confirmation window with "Finish".
    * A new file with the same name but ending with *.gpg* will have been created in the same folder.
* Linux:  
    * Files are encrypted and decrypted in the command line. You have to specify a *recipient*, which is either you (*name* or *email* you chose for the key), or someone you want to send the file to (you need to have their *public* key then):    
    ```gpg --output <encrypted-file.gpg> --encrypt --recipient <user> <file-to-encrypt>```


To **decrypt** a file, you need to have the *private* key of the intended recipient (when the file was encrypted). So the encrypted file will have to be encrypted for the name associated with one of your private keys.

* Mac OS X: 
    * You just have to double click on the *.gpg* file and it will prompt for the password. 
    * Alternatively, you may decrypt it via *right click > Services > OpenPGP: Decrypt file*.
    * You will be asked for the passphrase.
    * You can find the decrypted file in the same folder; the name may have been extended with a number in order to prevent overwriting the original file.
* Windows: 
    * You may decrypt by right clicking on the file and selecting *Decrypt and verify*. 
    * You will be asked for the passphrase.
    * *Note:* it is best if you change the *output folder* in order to prevent the original file to be overwritten.
    * You can find the decrypted file in the same folder (or specified output folder). 
* Linux:  
    * Similar to encryption of a file, using the command line.     
    ```gpg --output <decrypted-file.gpg> --decrypt <file-to-decrypt>```
 

You can find more useful information about file encryption on the [GnuPG manual pages](https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual/x110.html).

#### <a name="AESCrypt"></a> AESCrypt

[AESCrypt](https://www.aescrypt.com/) is a free, open-source tool which is available for Mac, Linux and Windows. It provides a secure way to **encrypt individual files**, using the industry standard Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).

*AESCrypt* is easy to use: On **Windows**, you only right-click on a file, select AES Encrypt (or Decrypt) and enter a password. On a **Mac**, you drag the file into the *AESCrypt* program and type in the password. On the **Linux** command line, you may use the command *aescrypt* along with the name of the file and the password.

The [AESCrypt website](https://www.aescrypt.com/) provides an excellent documentation on how to set up and use *AESCrypt*.

#### <a name="EncryptedZIP"></a> Encrypted zip file

Zip files can be password-protected, but the standard Zip encryption scheme is extremely weak. If your operating system has a built-in way to encrypt zip files, you probably shouldn't use it. You should use *AES-256* encryption. The tools discussed in the following do support *AES-256* encryption.

Zip files are archives containing individual files, so this cannot be used to encrypt entire volumes.

{% BgBox important %}
The older zip encryption is not secure! Several tools can create encrypted zip files (the older, insecure version). 

For example,

* On **Windows**, you can right-click on a file and select **Compress...** to create a zip archive.

* On **Linux or Mac**, this can be done via command line:    
    ```zip -0 -e backup.zip <yourfile>```    
    The option **-0** means "store only" and don't compress --- this is faster. **-e** means encrypt archive.    
It will ask for the password.


This is ***not secure!*** 

Use the more secure methods described in this section.

{% endBgBox %}



**Windows: 7-zip**

[7-zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) is great for compressing files and is also a strong file encryption tool. It's free even for commercial use and supports *256-bit AES* encryption. The official download is Windows only, but there are also unofficial Linux and OS X versions.

In *7-Zip*, you can select files in the Windows Explorer window, right-click and select **7-Zip > Add to archive**. You should make sure to select the *Add to archive* option in order to encrypt the file. You will be given the option to set a password, make sure you select one! Alternatively, you can open the *7-Zip* application and create the archive from there.

{% BgBox important %}
*7-Zip* will create a *7z* archive by default, but you can also choose *Zip*. If you *do* opt to go with Zip, be sure to select the *AES-256* encryption method instead of the weaker *ZipCrypto* method. 
{% endBgBox %}

**Mac: Keka**

With [Keka](http://www.kekaosx.com/), you compress individual files by dragging and dropping them to *Keka* in the Dock. You may drop multiple files at once, and they will be compressed as one zip file. You can get *Keka* from the Mac App Store, here is good documentation on the website on how to use it.

{% BgBox important %}
*Keka* creates encrypted *7z* files.By default, the *7z *files will be encrypted using *AES-256*, which is secure. If the selected format is *Zip*, *Zip 2.0* legacy encryption will be used, so this is not recommended!
{% endBgBox %}

**Linux: p7zip**

The file explorer on your Linux desktop can be used to create encrypted *7z* archives. You first need to install the *p7zip-full* package (it may also simply be called *p7zip* on some Linux distributions). Installing *p7zip-full* allows your file explorer encrypt your files or folders in the *7z* compression format. You may find it in your package manager, e.g. on Ubuntu

```sudo apt-get install p7zip-full```

Then, open your file explorer, right click on the file and select **Compress...**. Be sure to select *7z* as a format! In the window that comes up, expand **Other Options**, tick **encrypt the file list too** and type in your password.

You may also use *p7zip* in the command line. The command is simply called *7z*. Refer to the man pages for usage.

{% BgBox important %}
*p7zip* does not store the owner and group of a file. So if you want to use it for backup purposes (or for other reasons want to preserve owner/group), you should pack your files in a *tar* archive first, and then encrypt the tar archive with *p7zip*.

To create a tar archive:

```tar -cf <tar-file-name>.tar <list of your files or folders>```

To extract a tar archive:

```tar -xf <tar-file-name.tar>```

Then, compress the tar archive file with *p7zip* as described.
