You want to access your data and tools from any platform, and any location. For example, you want to check on the state of your running experiments while on conference travel, or using your laptop or tablet at home. In the Research Cloud, you can configure your own system: you may choose your OS and install the software you require. You can access this virtual computer from anywhere via the Internet.
