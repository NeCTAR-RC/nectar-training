  <h1> Create a ssh key </h1>

  <article class="post-content">
    
<p>First, we will need to create a <strong>ssh key pair</strong> for connecting to our instances. An ssh key pair is required to encrypt the data which is transferred to communicate with the instance. The pair consists of two keys: A <em>private</em> key, and a <em>public</em> key.  The public key is called “public” because that’s the one which is placed on the server and which you may upload online without worrying about security issues. It is useless without its counterpart, the <em>private</em> key. The private key is the secret key which you keep on your local computer so that you may connect to the instance. You should keep the private key very safe and never share it with anyone. Take care not to lose it, otherwise you won’t be able to connect to your machine. The connection to the machine only works with both keys.</p>

<p><img src="images/SSHKeys.png" class="aligncenter" style="width:70%; " alt="image" />
The image above shows two computers connected through their <em>ports</em>, with an ssh server and client encrypting the connection. Applications can use this secure ssh connection to exchange data.</p>

<p>We will first have to generate this key pair before we can proceed with launching an instance.</p>

<p>The ssh keys will have a <em>name</em>. You should choose a name that you can associate with your instance, for example “<em>Nectar_Key”</em>. As a general rule of thumb, file names should consist of alphanumeric characters and underscores ( _ ) only. You should avoid white spaces. They makes working with files on Unix systems a bit clumsy.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> The process differs between Unix/Mac Systems and Windows. Follow the steps described below for your platform, and then continue to the next section.</p>

<h3 id="mac-and-linux">Mac and Linux</h3>

<p>SSH key pairs can be generated with the <em>ssh-keygen</em> command.</p>

<p>If you choose <em>Nectar_Key</em> as your key name, you will have two files after the generation of keys: The private key, called <em>Nectar_Key</em> and the public key, called <em>Nectar_Key.pub</em>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Open your Unix or Mac Terminal. You will start off in your <em>“home”</em> directory. If you already had the terminal open before, make sure you are in the home directory, by simply typing   <br />
<code>cd</code>  <br />
Now, check if you already have a directory called <em>.ssh</em>, by typing  <br />
<code>ls -a</code>  <br />
A list of files in your home directory will be printed. If you don’t see the name <em>.ssh</em> in this list, create the directory (if you see the directory, skip this command):  <br />
<code>mkdir .ssh</code>  <br />
and change to this directory:  <br />
<code>cd .ssh</code>   <br />
Now generate the key with  <br />
<code>ssh-keygen -t rsa -f Nectar_Key</code>  <br />
This generates a pair of keys in the directory <em>.ssh</em>, which is the default location for ssh keys.  <br />
You will be asked to specify a passphrase. Choose a secure passphrase! But make sure that you store your password somewhere safe - you will not be able to connect to your instance if you forget the password!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You will have generated (1) a key you keep private, named <em>Nectar_Key</em> and (2) a public key, named <em>Nectar_Key.pub</em>. If you type  <br />
<code>ls</code>  <br />
Then you should see both files listed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Open the public key file with your favourite text editor. If you don’t have a favourite editor, here are some suggestions:  <br />
On a <strong>Mac</strong>, type  <br />
<code>open -e Nectar_Key.pub</code>  <br />
which should open the key in TextEdit.   <br />
On a <strong>Linux</strong> gnome environment (e.g. Unity), type  <br />
<code>gedit Nectar_Key</code>  <br />
or if you are using KDE, type   <br />
<code>kate Nectar_Key</code>  <br />
If you are using another desktop environment we assume you are familiar with your favourite text editor.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Copy <em>all</em> the text which is contained in the file <em>Nectar_Key.pub</em> into the clipboard. With CTRL+A you can mark all text, and with CTRL+C copy it (on a Mac it is Command (⌘) instead of CTRL). You will need the contents of the public key on the keyboard in one of the next steps.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="windows">Windows</h3>

<p>Open the <strong>PuTTYgen</strong> program by clicking on <em>PuTTYgen.exe</em> which you downloaded in the beginning of this tutorial.</p>

<p><img src="images/scrPuttyGen1.png" class="alignright" style="width:350px; margin-left:20px;" alt="image" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>For <strong>Type of key to generate</strong>, select <strong>SSH-2 RSA</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click on <strong>Generate</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Move your mouse in the area below the progress bar. When the progress bar is full, PuTTYgen generates your key pair.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p style="clear:both"></p>

<p><img src="images/scrPuttyGen2.png" class="alignright" style="width:350px; margin-left:20px;" alt="image" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Type a passphrase in the <strong>Key passphrase</strong> field. Choose a secure passphrase! Type the same passphrase in the <strong>Confirm passphrase</strong> field.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Right-click in the text field “<strong>Public key for pasting into OpenSSH authorized_keys file</strong>” and choose <strong>Select All</strong>. Right-click again in the same text field and choose <strong>Copy</strong>. This copies the content onto the clipboard, we will need to paste it somewhere else in one of the next steps.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click the <strong>Save private key</strong> button to save the private key. It is important that you save the key, because you will need the file later. So save it in a folder where you can find it again. In this exercise, we will name the file <em>Nectar_Key.ppk</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Save your public key as well by clicking the <strong>Save public key</strong> button. As a file name, type <em>Nectar_Key.pub.txt</em>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
