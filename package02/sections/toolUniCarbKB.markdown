**UniCarbKB** is an initiative that aims to promote the creation of an online information storage and search platform for glycomics and glycobiology research. The knowledgebase will offer a freely accessible and information-rich resource supported by querying interfaces, annotation technologies and the adoption of common standards to integrate structural, experimental and functional data.
