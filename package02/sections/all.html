<h2 id="biodiversity-and-climate-change-bccvl">Biodiversity and Climate Change (BCCVL)</h2>

<p><strong>Target field(s):</strong> Ecology, environmental and climate change science, land use planning, natural resources.</p>

<p><strong>Website:</strong> <a href="http://www.bccvl.org.au/">http://www.bccvl.org.au/</a></p>

<p><img src="images/logoBccvl.png" class="alignleft" style="width:70px; margin-right:20px;" alt="image" /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>The <strong>Biodiversity and Climate Change Virtual Laboratory (BCCVL)</strong> is a decision support and scenario planning tool that simplifies the process of biodiversity and climate change modelling. It connects the research community to Australia’s national computation infrastructure by integrating a suite of tools in a coherent online environment. Users can access biodiversity, climate and environmental data from global online datasets or upload their own datasets, perform data analysis such as Species Distribution Models with a suite of 19 different algorithms, and easily visualise, interpret and evaluate the results of the models.</p>

<h3 id="intended-users">Intended users</h3>

<p>The BCCVL is designed for ecologists, environmental and climate change scientists, students, and consultants. Beyond this, the BCCVL makes for a great training platform for both researchers, consultants and those involved in land use planning and require decision support tools to help mitigate risk and determine how to best use available natural resources.</p>

<h3 id="use-cases">Use Cases</h3>
<p>Species Distribution Model Experiments
Used to investigate the potential distribution of a species under current climatic and environmental conditions. The BCCVL provides access to 17 Species Distribution Model algorithms which can be run simultaneously.</p>

<p><strong>Climate Change Experiments</strong></p>

<p>With the BCCVL, you can investigate the distribution of a species under potential future climatic conditions. Take the results of your Species Distribution Modelling experiment, and project that distribution for a certain year in the future with the climate information from one of several climate models. Select one of several greenhouse gas emissions scenarios to influence the climate models. Future climates are available from 2015 to 2085.</p>

<p><strong>Biodiverse Experiments</strong></p>

<p>Biodiverse is a system to compute indices of biodiversity. In the BCCVL it calculates gridded estimates of species richness and endemism based on previously run SDMs.</p>

<p><strong>Species Trait Model Experiment <em>(currently under development)</em></strong></p>

<p>Used to investigate the potential distribution of a species under current climatic and environmental conditions based on one or more traits/characteristics of that species (e.g. size, colour, heat tolerance)</p>

<p><strong>Ensemble Analysis <em>(currently under development)</em></strong></p>

<p>To reduce the uncertainty of using the single-model, or single-emissions-scenario approach to investigating climate change impacts on biodiversity, you can run an ensemble experiment. 
You can run several different species distribution models for one species, when assessing the distribution under current climate. If looking at a climate change scenario, you can use the output of several different climate models with one species distribution model, or take the average of the climate model outputs and input this into several different species distribution models. This approach can also be used to assess a range of climate change emissions scenarios.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-get-access">How to get access</h3>
<p>The BCCVL is free to use. Anyone with an Australian institutional ID (recognised by the Australian Access Federation) can <a href="https://app.bccvl.org.au/login">log in</a> and begin modelling. Individuals may also <a href="http://www.bccvl.org.au/request-a-local-login-account/">request a local login account</a> and we will create one for you!</p>

<h2 id="industrial-ecology-ielab">Industrial Ecology (IELab)</h2>

<p><strong>Target field(s):</strong> Industrial ecology (IE), regional economics, transition analysis, MRIO tables, 
Hybrid LCA data, economic and environmental data.</p>

<p><strong>Website:</strong>  <a href="http://ielab.info">http://ielab.info</a></p>

<p><strong>See also:</strong> <a href="http://nectar.org.au/labs/tracking-the-global-supply-chain/">http://nectar.org.au/labs/tracking-the-global-supply-chain/</a></p>

<p><img src="images/logoIELab.png" class="alignleft" style="width:70px; margin-right:10px;" alt="image" />
The <strong>Industrial Ecology Virtual Laboratory (IELab)</strong> is a cloud-based research platform 
for enviro-socio-economic modelling. It provides the most comprehensive, 
environmentally extended input-output model available for use in Australia. It 
distinguishes geographical and industry detail at high resolution, spans a time period of 
more than twenty years, and is constantly updated as new data becomes available. 
Dozens of organisations, researchers and practitioners collaborate in the IELab to build 
and modify their own customised input-output analytics in fields such as regional and 
environmental economic modelling, life-cycle assessment, carbon footprinting and 
environmental impact assessment. The IELab brings together economic, environmental 
and social data in unprecedented detail and significantly boosts Australia’s ability to 
make strategic decisions for progress towards sustainability.</p>

<p>The IELab’s direction is co-steered by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, ensuring that 
IELab outputs conform to national accounting standards, thus instilling credibility and 
trust. The creation of a Global IELab has started, aimed at adopting the concept at a 
global level and combining the strengths of some of the existing global multi-region 
input-output frameworks. The long- term goal of IELab researchers is that the VL 
concept becomes best-practice and a reference point for undertaking environmental 
and economic modelling, and that it will make multi-disciplinary research happen by 
providing one common platform that helps answering questions from different areas.</p>

<h3 id="intended-users-1">Intended users</h3>

<p>Three groups in particular benefit from IELab infrastructure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <strong><em>broader academic research community</em></strong>. The IELab is applicable to research in 
areas such as industrial ecology (IE), regional economics, transition analysis, 
sustainability and environmental impact assessments as well as participatory 
modelling.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><em>Private sector companies and consultancies</em></strong> specialised in triple-bottom-line and 
sustainability assessments. Consultants are attracted to the rich ensemble of Hybrid 
LCA data, the ease of regionalisation of economic and environmental data and the 
analytical tools provided by IELab.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><em>Public sector agencies</em></strong>. The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) has shown a strong 
interest in the compilation of detailed MRIO tables and environmental satellite 
accounts by the IELab, since the ABS does not have the resources to produce these 
itself. Other public sector organisations that might find IELab data and tools useful 
included e.g. the Productivity Commission, CSIRO, ASIC, Environment Protection 
Authorities, etc.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="use-cases-1">Use cases</h3>

<p>Despite only having been developed over the last two years, the IElab has already 
succeeded in bringing together a diverse set of sustainability researchers and 
practitioners from around Australia, enabling tangible, inter-disciplinary research 
outputs. These include published triple bottom line assessments of industrial biofuel 
production [1,2] and large-scale biorefining [3], low-carbon construction materials [4-6] 
and high-resolution waste modelling [7-9]. The current IELab already provides a much-used basis for 
data and analysis in industry-relevant, cooperative research, including integrated 
sustainability assessments and tools for the construction industry* and the water 
industry**.</p>

as well as the water-energy-carbon links project ARC LP120200745.</p>

<p><img src="images/scrIELab.png" class="aligncenter" style="width:90%; " alt="image" /></p>

<h3 id="how-to-get-access-1">How to get access</h3>

<p>There main information and collaboration website for the IELab project is the “IELab 
Hub” at <a href="http://ielab.info">ielab.info</a>.
From there users can access the data and tools of the virtual 
laboratory through the “IELab Portal” which country-specific, e.g. 
<a href="http://ielab-aus.info">ielab-aus.info</a>.</p>

<p>Access to the IELab is open to any registered user and free for basic/public data, 
datafeeds and analytical functionality. Datafeed code is open source (subject to 
appropriate referencing and citation); optimiser code is compiled and free for research 
use by registered users. Access to full data, datafeeds and analytical functionality will 
incur a subscription fee from mid 2016, depending on the type of usage. Users may 
request paid access to restricted data on a one-off basis. Submission of data to the 
repository via datafeed is open to all registered users and may lead to the discounting 
or waiving of subscription fees. The fee structure is gradational, depending on the type 
of user (distinguishing Expert Researchers, Research Community, Public Sector, 
Consultants, Distributors and Teachers/Trainers). Fees are discounted or waived for 
one year if the user contributes well-structured, fully functional datafeeds. Discounted 
pricing will be available for lower-middle and low-income countries.  Essentially, this 
plan follows standard open-source software revenue models (source code and basic 
data is free) while at the same time establishing a viable financial model for the long-
term future of the project.</p>

<p><strong>Website:</strong> <a href="https://www.faims.edu.au/">www.faims.edu.au</a></p>

<p><strong>Maintained by:</strong> Macquarie University</p>

<p>The Field Acquired Information Management Systems Project (<a href="https://www.faims.edu.au">FAIMS project</a>) is an eResearch initiative developed at UNSW, Australia and currently housed at the Department of Ancient History at Macquarie University. Led by two archaeologists, a historian and a digital humanist and aided by casual programming staff, the FAIMS team has delivered 25 field recording systems over its lifetime (2012-present) to various field disciplines from archaeology, ecology, to geochemistry. We have a history of excellence in requirements elicitation, testing, delivering, and maintaining research-capable digital recording modules.</p>

<p>The project builds or interoperates with tools for the management of archaeological data across its entire lifecycle, from digital field data collection, through online data processing, to dataset archiving and publication. 
FAIMS includes three principal tools:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The FAIMS mobile data collection platform, developed internally;</li>
  <li>Heurist (University of Sydney), an online data refinement system;</li>
  <li>The FAIMS online repository, an adaptation of the Digital Archaeological Record (Digital Antiquity).</li>
</ul>

<p>The FAIMS project was launched in 2012 at the UNSW, Australia, with funding from the National eResearch Collaboration Tools and Resources (NeCTAR) initiative - an Australian government initiative to build digital infrastructure. The project began with community stock-taking activities, including surveys and workshops incorporating US, European, and Australian archaeologists. Based on their requirements, we joined existing open-source projects for a data refinement web application (Heurist) and an online repository (the Digital Archaeological Record). Since no software for field data collection existed that met the needs of our stakeholders, we also initiated our own development of an open source Android-Linux mobile data collection platform.</p>

<p>Development continued in 2014-15 thanks to funding from the Australian Research Council’s Linkage Infrastructure, Equipment and Facilities (LIEF) scheme, which supports cooperative initiatives to develop expensive infrastructure for higher education researchers. LIEF funding has continued earlier activities. It also allows us to extend FAIMS interoperability to additional online data services (Open Context, Mukurtu, and OCHRE) and supports a portal for research access to Australian state heritage registers through a partnership with the University of Queensland.</p>

<h1 id="field-data-collection">Field Data Collection</h1>

<p>The FAIMS mobile data collection platform helps researchers document cultural and natural heritage. The app allows people to collect information using their personal Android devices in many settings including remote locations with no internet access. As well, we help organisations get the information they need to improve awareness and develop appropriate management strategies. Better strategies have the potential of building more readiness and engagement in the participating communities, thereby boosting our social and natural environment.</p>

<p>It is is a world-class, open-source platform for developing mobile systems to acquire structured, text, geospatial, and multimedia data during field research. Designed cooperatively with practitioners to address the requirements of research under difficult conditions, it can be customised for projects across many domains, with applications in university, government, and business sectors. It is being used across Australia and internationally.</p>

<p>FAIMS developed and deployed community-driven software developed in response to researchers’ expressed requirements. The development consists of a flexible data capture platform consisting of a “core” Android application that can be deeply customised to particular research activities. Customisations can be readily shared, adapted, and redeployed. The system accommodates gigabyte-sized datasets and hundreds of devices. FAIMS works offline, automatically synchronises data collected by multiple teams, eliminates double-entry, and automates export - saving time and reducing errors. It also fosters the creation and sharing of syntactically and semantically interoperable datasets by, e.g., embedding URIs in records to link to online ontologies. All software is licenced GPLv3 and freely available on GitHub.</p>

<p>The mobile platform consists of an offline-capable Android mobile application supported by an Ubuntu server. The server may be local (for projects working in remote areas without internet access), but in many cases it is delivered as a cloud service (for projects that have regular - but not necessarily continuous - internet access).</p>

<h1 id="heurist-collaboration">Heurist Collaboration</h1>

<p>Heurist is an online data analysis and visualisation platform developed since 2007 by Arts eResearch at the University of Sydney (http://heuristnetwork.org/), as an option for data refinement, analysis, export and project creation.</p>

<p>Heurist can be used for routine data editing, but it also facilitates fundamental reorganisation and rethinking of data. For example, its visualisation and association capabilities help decisions regarding which excavation contexts should be included in which horizons, or which individual artefacts should be classified as which types. FAIMS is working with Arts eResearch to ensure a smooth, automated workflow that takes data from creation in the mobile application, through refinement in Heurist, to processing in ArcGIS (and other commercial software), and finally archiving and dissemination in tDAR, Open Context, or other online repositories.</p>

<p>Visit <a href="http://heuristnetwork.org/">heuristnetwork.org</a> for more details.</p>

<h1 id="the-repository">The Repository</h1>

<p>The FAIMS repository is a digital archive for storing data sets, documents, images, and sensory data produced by archaeological research in Australia or collected by Australian archaeologists working abroad.</p>

<p>The repository is powered by the Digital Archaeological Record (tDAR) software which was developed by Digital Antiquity, and incorporates the Australian Historical Archaeological Database (AHAD) which was developed by VeRSI and La Trobe eResearch in partnership with Digital Antiquity.</p>

This project comprises tools for the <strong>Australian Synchroton</strong> community.
The <em>Australian Synchrotron</em> is a world-class national research facility that uses accelerator technology to produce a powerful source of light—x-rays and infrared radiation—a million times brighter than the sun.</p>

<p>The facility has nine different experimental stations, or beamlines, which harness that light so researchers can see the fundamental structure and composition of materials, on scales ranging from the atomic to the macroscopic – with a level of detail, speed and accuracy not possible in conventional laboratories.</p>

<p>The integration with NeCTAR eResearch tools will enable scientific users of the community to have instant access to the results of data during the course of their experiments, facilitating better decision-making and providing opportunities for ongoing data analysis via remote access.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>In this module, you have learned what eResearch tools and Virtual Laboratories are. You should now have a general idea of what <em>Virtual Labs</em> and <em>eResearch tools</em> are and maybe you have found a tool that is “ready to use” for you.</p>

<p>In summary, Virtual Labs <em>vs</em> eResearch Tools:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Virtual labs:
    <ul>
      <li>on-line platforms offering a collection of <strong>discipline-specific</strong> tools and data.</li>
      <li>create <strong>new platforms</strong> for collaboration and information sharing.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>eResearch tools:
    <ul>
      <li>offer a variety of research software for the Australian research community, often addressing researchers <strong>across disciplines</strong>.</li>
      <li>focus on <strong>enhancing existing tools</strong> and applications.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you have not identified any tool or virtual lab that you may benefit from, there is still one major NeCTAR service which you will be interested in: <strong>The Research Cloud</strong>. The next modules will cover usage of Cloud Computing for your research.</p>

<p>Continue with <a href="/package03/sections/index.html" title="Module 3">Module 3</a> which will discuss a few common use cases for the NeCTAR Research Cloud.</p>
