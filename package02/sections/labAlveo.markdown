Alveo is a **web-based data discovery application** for examining collections of **human communication data**. It can be accessed using any web browser.
It provides on-line infrastructure for accessing human communication data sets (speech, texts, music, video, etc.) and for using specialised tools for searching, analysing and annotating that data.
There are a number of tools available:

- The **Alveo Data Collections** are aggregated from other sources and are configured for quick searching. In particular, Alveo permits searching on the content of these data sets.

- The **Galaxy workflow engine**, that was developed for bioinformatics research, has been adapted so that it is useful for working with human communication data and integrated into Alveo.

- The **R Project** for Statistical Computing provides a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics.

- **EMU** is a collection of software tools for the creation, manipulation and analysis of speech databases.
