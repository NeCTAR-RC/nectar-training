The **Australian Schizophrenia Research Bank** is Australias largest ever "brain bank" research project, which is expected to play a crucial role in the international search for a schizophrenia cure.

One of the greatest challenges in schizophrenia research has been getting access to scientific data from a large enough sample of patients to be able to make statistically robust and reliable conclusions. The Australian Schizophrenia Research Bank will allow scientists to analyse vital genetic and brain information from schizophrenia sufferers on a scale never before possible.

The primary aim of the Australian Schizophrenia Research Bank is to facilitate scientific research into schizophrenia by:

* Collecting, storing and providing comprehensive, cross-referenced clinical, neuropsychological, genetic and brain imaging data from people with schizophrenia and healthy controls.

* Recruitment of volunteers to participate in specific schizophrenia research projects.
