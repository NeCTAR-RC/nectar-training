**ZoaTrack** (previously known as *OzTrack*) provides tools for the storage, analysis and visualisation of animal tracking data.
The project encourages the aggregation, preservation, and potential re-use, of animal telemetry data. This is a free-to-use web-based platform for analysing and visualising animal location data.
