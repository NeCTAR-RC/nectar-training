The <strong>Industrial Ecology Virtual Laboratory (IELab)</strong> is a cloud-based research platform 
for enviro-socio-economic modelling. It provides the most comprehensive, 
environmentally extended input-output model available for use in Australia. It 
distinguishes geographical and industry detail at high resolution, spans a time period of 
more than twenty years, and is constantly updated as new data becomes available. 
Dozens of organisations, researchers and practitioners collaborate in the IELab to build 
and modify their own customised input-output analytics in fields such as regional and 
environmental economic modelling, life-cycle assessment, carbon footprinting and 
environmental impact assessment. The IELab brings together economic, environmental 
and social data in unprecedented detail and significantly boosts Australia’s ability to 
make strategic decisions for progress towards sustainability.</p>

<p>The IELab’s direction is co-steered by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, ensuring that 
IELab outputs conform to national accounting standards, thus instilling credibility and 
trust. The creation of a Global IELab has started, aimed at adopting the concept at a 
global level and combining the strengths of some of the existing global multi-region 
input-output frameworks. The long- term goal of IELab researchers is that the VL 
concept becomes best-practice and a reference point for undertaking environmental 
and economic modelling, and that it will make multi-disciplinary research happen by 
providing one common platform that helps answering questions from different areas.</p>

<h3 id="intended-users">Intended users</h3>

<p>Three groups in particular benefit from IELab infrastructure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <strong><em>broader academic research community</em></strong>. The IELab is applicable to research in 
areas such as industrial ecology (IE), regional economics, transition analysis, 
sustainability and environmental impact assessments as well as participatory 
modelling.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><em>Private sector companies and consultancies</em></strong> specialised in triple-bottom-line and 
sustainability assessments. Consultants are attracted to the rich ensemble of Hybrid 
LCA data, the ease of regionalisation of economic and environmental data and the 
analytical tools provided by IELab.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><em>Public sector agencies</em></strong>. The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) has shown a strong 
interest in the compilation of detailed MRIO tables and environmental satellite 
accounts by the IELab, since the ABS does not have the resources to produce these 
itself. Other public sector organisations that might find IELab data and tools useful 
included e.g. the Productivity Commission, CSIRO, ASIC, Environment Protection 
Authorities, etc.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="use-cases">Use cases</h3>

<p>Despite only having been developed over the last two years, the IElab has already 
succeeded in bringing together a diverse set of sustainability researchers and 
practitioners from around Australia, enabling tangible, inter-disciplinary research 
outputs. These include published triple bottom line assessments of industrial biofuel 
production [1,2] and large-scale biorefining [3], low-carbon construction materials [4-6] 
and high-resolution waste modelling [7-9]. The current IELab already provides a much-used basis for 
data and analysis in industry-relevant, cooperative research, including integrated 
sustainability assessments and tools for the construction industry* and the water 
industry**.</p>

<p>* CRC for Low Carbon Living projects RP2002 and RP2007, ARC LP120200306 and ARC DP150100962.</p>

<p>** Project WRRF-14-03 funded by the Water Reuse Research Foundation and the Australian Water Recycling Centre of Excellence, 
as well as the water-energy-carbon links project ARC LP120200745.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-get-access">How to get access</h3>

<p>There main information and collaboration website for the IELab project is the “IELab 
Hub” at <a href="http://ielab.info">ielab.info</a>.
From there users can access the data and tools of the virtual 
laboratory through the “IELab Portal” which country-specific, e.g. 
<a href="http://ielab-aus.info">ielab-aus.info</a>.</p>

<p>Access to the IELab is open to any registered user and free for basic/public data, 
datafeeds and analytical functionality. Datafeed code is open source (subject to 
appropriate referencing and citation); optimiser code is compiled and free for research 
use by registered users. Access to full data, datafeeds and analytical functionality will 
incur a subscription fee from mid 2016, depending on the type of usage. Users may 
request paid access to restricted data on a one-off basis. Submission of data to the 
repository via datafeed is open to all registered users and may lead to the discounting 
or waiving of subscription fees. The fee structure is gradational, depending on the type 
of user (distinguishing Expert Researchers, Research Community, Public Sector, 
Consultants, Distributors and Teachers/Trainers). Fees are discounted or waived for 
one year if the user contributes well-structured, fully functional datafeeds. Discounted 
pricing will be available for lower-middle and low-income countries.  Essentially, this 
plan follows standard open-source software revenue models (source code and basic 
data is free) while at the same time establishing a viable financial model for the long-
term future of the project.</p>
