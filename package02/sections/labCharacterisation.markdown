Imaging techniques, broadly known as **"Characterisation"**, are used in a number of research fields, from structural biology, to neuroimaging, and the analysis of energy materials.

The **Characterisation Virtual Lab** has developed many tools, including a remote desktop for processing data from microscopes or the Australian Synchrotron on a supercomputer which has graphics processors (GPUs) for fast image processing.

In summary, what the Characterisation Virtual Lab does:

* Integrating key Australian imaging instruments with specialised computing capabilities.
* Developing a common desktop environment for analysis and collaboration.
* Creating four desktop environments for data processing in neuroscience, structural biology, atom probe and X-ray science. Each driver is led by a world-class research group, is supported by an Australian research consortium and is in a national research priority area. The results from this development will be distributed to the community through the CVL Workbenches.
* Integrate key Australian imaging instruments with specialised computing capabilities.
