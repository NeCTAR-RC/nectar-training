The **MARine Virtual Laboratory (MARVL)** can provide all the tools necessary to construct a virtual environment of a region of interest in marine environments.
Comprised of a suite of complex models (e.g. ocean circulation, waves, water quality, and marine biogeochemistry), a network of observing sensors, and a host of value-adding tools, MARVL can underpin research to understand the dynamics, interactions, and connectivity of an estuarine/coastal region, continental shelf region, or open ocean domain.

The website provides comprehensive information about MARVL.
