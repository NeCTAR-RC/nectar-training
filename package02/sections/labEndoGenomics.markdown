The **Endocrine Virtual Laboratory (endoVL)** is a national initiative to establish a range of clinical registries supporting genetically focused clinical trials and studies targeted to the needs of the endocrine research communities, networks and societies across Australia.

* Easily and securely access clinical and bioinformatics data sets.
* Share data sets and collaborate nationally and internationally with clinical communities and patients.

The establishment of endoVL shall demonstrate how Australia-wide endocrine research can be augmented and translated into a clinical (translational) context, leveraging and integrating –omics capabilities. This will realise the vision of personalised e-Health by providing a seamless, user-oriented research environment and will show how –omics research can itself be directly shaped from contextual clinical information on the patients involved.
