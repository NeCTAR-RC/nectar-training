The **All-Sky Virtual Observatory (ASVO)** is enabling researchers to access a growing collection of theoretical and observational datasets, via a distributed network of ASVO "Nodes". 

Two Australian astronomical facilities were chosen to form the first pillars of the All-Sky Virtual Observatory: Optical data from the Southern Sky Survey, obtained using the *SkyMapper* telescope; And the Theoretical Astrophysical Observatory (TAO).

In summary, the All-Sky Virtual Observatory

* Links observational data sets and theoretical infrastructure capabilities enabling new approaches to astronomical research.
* Provides access to a test environment, the **SkyMapper** Test Data Release, which provides a preview of the characteristics and data access protocols for the SkyMapper Southern Sky Survey.
