The **Humanities Virtual Lab (HuNI)** is a new research and discovery platform developed by and for humanities and creative arts scholars. HuNI is integrating many important cultural data sets for researchers in the humanities: it combines information from 30 of Australia's most significant cultural datasets. These datasets comprise more than 2 million authoritative records relating to the people, organisations, objects and events that make up Australia's rich cultural heritage. HuNI also enables researchers to work with and share this large-scale aggregation of cultural information. 

The Human Communication Science Virtual Laboratory aims at cross-disciplinary interaction and information sharing between researchers. It is built for researchers from several disciplines: speech science, computer science, behavioural science, linguistics, music cognition and musicology, sonics and acoustics.
