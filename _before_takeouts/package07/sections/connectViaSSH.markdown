To connect to your instance, you will need its IP address. You should have just written this down, or you can look it up on the Dashboard (*Compute > Instances*).

In the following text, your **IP address** is described as **NNN.NNN.NNN.NNN**, which you will have to replace with your own instance’s IP address.

To get a secure connection, we need to log on to the instance via ssh. 

### Connect via ssh

#### Step 1: Test connectivity

First, let’s do a little test to see if your instance is reachable. On Linux/Mac, you can use the command line shell that you have just opened.  
On Windows, open your *Windows command line*.

Use the terminal to try to *"ping"* your instance (checking that you can reach it):

```ping NNN.NNN.NNN.NNN```

replacing the N’s with the IP address of your NeCTAR instance you noted above.

The *ping* command just sends a simple signal to your instance and checks whether it responds. If the ping does not work, then most likely neither will any of the following steps. The ping has worked if you get a response every few seconds, e.g. 

{% BgBox terminal %}
PING 144.6.227.170     
(144.6.227.170) 56(84) bytes of data.    
64 bytes from 144.6.227.170: icmp_seq=1 ttl=49 time=354 ms    
64 bytes from 144.6.227.170: icmp_seq=2 ttl=49 time=358 ms    
{% endBgBox %}

#### Step 2: Logging in

We will now log in to our instance using ssh with the private key (the username might be different depending on the image you launched).

Follow the instructions below for the operating system of your local computer.

*Note:* If the ping has worked but the SSH connection does not work after following instructions below, follow the troubleshooting steps in the [Appendix](appendices.html).

**Linux/Mac** 

We will need a command line shell (a "Terminal") in this exercise. 
On **Linux and Mac**, you have a built-in terminal. Open it now (if you are unsure how, refer to [Notes / Disclaimers](#heading=h.7tnskttjeoet)).

Go to your command line and type

```ssh -i Nectar_Key ubuntu@NNN.NNN.NNN.NNN```

using your own IP address instead of NNN.NNN.NNN.NNN. 
The command line will ask you to establish the authenticity of the server. Type "yes".

You will then be asked for your passphrase (that's the one you chose when generating the SSH Key).

*Note*: If you named your key other than *Nectar_Key*, you should replace this with your own private key file name here. If you saved the private key in another folder, you will have to specify the full path to it (e.g. *ssh -i /home/hans/yourkeyfolder/Nectar_Key NNN.NNN.NNN.NNN*). 

*On a Mac:*

You may have to specify the full path to the key. If the above does not work, try instead:

```ssh -i $HOME/.ssh/Nectar_Key ubuntu@NNN.NNN.NNN.NNN```

{% BgBox info %}
Our instance has a default **username** that we need to specify when we log in. In this tutorial, we chose a Ubuntu Image when launching the instance. At the time of writing, the user name for Ubuntu is ***"ubuntu"***. Other NeCTAR images may expect different usernames. 

Try using *root* instead of *ubuntu* ("*root@NNN.NNN.NNN.NNN*") for other Operating Systems. For Fedora, the user name may be *ec2-user*. The right user name for the image you chose is documented at the [NeCTAR Image_Catalog](https://wiki.rc.nectar.org.au/wiki/Image_Catalog).
{% endBgBox %}

*Well done!*

Now, you should be connected to your instance and your ssh terminal command line is ready to use.

**Windows**

On a windows system, we will use the **PuTTY** terminal to connect to the instance. 
We first have to set up our PuTTY session to include the details of our instance, including the keys we are using.

Double-click on the file "*PuTTY.exe*" which you downloaded when you created the SSH key.

In your PuTTY Window, type your instance’s IP address into the "**Host**" field (you should have taken a note about the IP address earlier, if not you can find it on the Dashboard: Go to *Compute > Instances*).

{% img src=images/scrPutty1.png, w=50, dim=percent, alt=image, align=center %}

Then, select the “**Data**” category in the navigation window. Here, we will have to specify the **username**. Choose “*ubuntu*” as your username. Leave the other fields on default settings.

{% endBgBox %}


Next, click on the "**SSH > Auth**" sub-category. There is a field labelled "**Private key file for authentication**". Click on the "**Browse**" button:

{% img src=images/scrPutty3.png, w=50, dim=percent, alt=image, align=center %}

In the browse window that comes up, select the private SSH key file that you saved on your computer earlier (we named it *Nectar_Key*)

{% BgBox info %}
*Note*: If you have generated your ssh key on a Linux system and now need to convert it to Windows, see how to do this in the [Appendix](appendices.html).

Instead of converting keys, you can also simply create a separate set of keys to use with PuTTY. In this case, you have to add the new key as an authorized key on the instance. See the [Appendix](appendices.html) for instructions on how to do this. 
{% endBgBox %}

Now, return to the "**Session**" screen in the left navigation window. This is the screen we started at. We will save our settings (the "session"), so that in future we don’t need to type in all the details again. In the “**Saved Sessions**” section, choose any name for this session so that you can remember it, for example “*MyNeCTARInstance*”. Then, click on the "**Save**" button.


{% img src=images/scrPutty4.png, w=50, dim=percent, alt=image, align=center %}

Now, connect to the instance by clicking the “**Open**” button. The first time that you connect, you will be asked to verify the identity of the remote server. This is expected the first time you connect to a new server, so you can select "*Yes*" to continue. You will be prompted for a passphrase. Type in the passphrase that you used to create the SSH key earlier on. 


{% BgBox info %}
Every time you connect to the instance via Putty, you will have to type in your passphrase. This may get a little cumbersome, so note that there is a tool called ***Pageant*** that you can get on the same page where you downloaded [PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html). Pageant is an *SSH authentication agent*. It holds your private keys in memory, already decoded, so that you can use them often without needing to type the passphrase every time. It also eliminates the need to explicitly specify the relevant key to each user account, if you use more than one account to log into a server.

We will *not* use pageant in this tutorial, but you may be interested to read up on how to use it. You can find instruction in the [Appendix](appendices.html).
{% endBgBox %}


**Well done!**

Now, a black Terminal window should open and your command line is ready to use.
